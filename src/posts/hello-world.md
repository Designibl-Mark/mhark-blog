Hello World üëãüèª

I‚Äôm incredibly happy to share that I have been promoted to CTO at [Spot Ship](https://spot-ship.com "Spot Ship") üéâ & with this transition I thought it was about time I started up my blog.

Spot Ship has been a fantastic journey, and I'm incredibly excited to continue to be one of the driving forces of growth in the company.

It has been an amazing year for us and we have consistently shown the industry what we are capable of. My team have really embraced the challenges I have set them, in driving quality and continuous learnings throughout our work leading us to where we are today. It is in no small part due to the fantastic team I have supporting me that allows us to create the best tech the Shipping Industry has seen to date.

Over the last year we have grown in number and I look forward to us further expanding so that we can reinforce our team and continue on our trajectory. If your interested in all things `Nextjs`, `Python`, `Supabase (Postgres)` and you would like to join our team in the future, feel free to reach out so we can get to know each other for when that hiring starts.

I am forever grateful to everyone who has supported me in my career, especially those who have enabled me to take risks or provided me with opportunities for growth. It has been a journey of continuous learning and setbacks that has prepared me to make the most of the position that I am in now.

As always if you want to hear more about Spot Ship, feel free to reach out. We are working hard to continuously improve our platform that promotes the economic growth of our clients through streamlining their data flow and collection, simultaneously enabling us to make substantial savings in CO2 for the industry.
