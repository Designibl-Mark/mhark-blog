This is a question I am asked regularly for advice on how to get your first job as a software engineer.

## Context

The route I took is relatively traditional:

School ‚û°Ô∏è University ‚û°Ô∏è Summer Internship ‚û°Ô∏è Graduate Scheme

### School

I studied physics, maths & electronics for A-level and had been making my own websites (HTML & CSS) since I was about 10 or 11. When doing my electronics coursework I was introduced to Visual Basic, and later taught myself to code Basic so that I had more control over what I could do. Later I also picked up Lua in no small part due to playing [Computercraft](https://tweaked.cc/)

### University

I studied at the University of Leicester, my first year was in "Electronic Engineering with Software" then I swapped to do a BSc in Computer Science as I found I much preferred all my Software modules and that's where my true interest lay. I got a good foundation in many aspects but particularly in Java and enjoyed learning about UX and HCI. I was lucky that my course was incredibly practical and less theoretical which is why I had been drawn to apply there.

### Summer Internship

Having narrowly prevented myself making the mistake of doing a summer of door to door sales (what was I thinking üôà), I attended a talk at University about working at different companies, one of which was Tesco. This prompted me to apply to their internship scheme just before the deadline.

Sandwiched in the summer before my final year of University I managed to get a [3 month internship at Tesco Technology](https://www.tesco-programmes.com/internships/) joining the transport and tracking team. This was a great experience of what engineering as a job looked like, and I had some fantastic mentors who introduced me to all kinds of things like Agile methodologies and Test driven development. Everything I had been learning at University started to make sense in how to apply what had been theoretical up to that point, into practical applications.

### Graduate Scheme

Off the back of my internship I was offered a place on [the graduate scheme](https://www.tesco-programmes.com/graduates/) and joined the profile team. This time I was dealing more closely with the internal apis, databases and infrastructure giving me a great understanding of how these should work at massive scale. Later on in the graduate scheme I completed a placement in Tesco labs where we got to take on our own R\&D project in a small group which was both great fun and took me into the world of Android development for the first time.

## So is that what I have to do?

Short answer no.

I have hired a lot of people who have different backgrounds on how they got into the industry such as:

* Short intensive courses like [Makers](https://makers.tech/).
* Did a completely different degree, then applied as a junior engineer.
* Just taught themselves everything.

Doing a degree was the right choice for me as I was still working out what I wanted to be and it offers a solid basis in a lot of aspects of computer science, many of which I have used and plenty I have never thought about again. I also got incredibly lucky with having a well designed and run internship and graduate scheme, these are hard to find to start with and can be highly competitive to get into.

Having said that, it depends on what is the environment you want to work at and how much effort are you willing to put in to prove you can do the job you are applying for.

For better or worse a degree is a piece of paper with a grade that somewhat guarantees a company the level of capability and knowledge an otherwise untested individual is coming in with. This is why it is so often stipulated as part of job adverts. Jobs especially at big companies get so many applicants that they add this barrier of entry in to easily narrow their view of what candidates to concentrate on. So in these cases if you don't go down that route, you tend to have to go the extra mile to prove why you should be hired.

The thing to concentrate on is how can I make the choice of hiring me easy?

## Tips on standing out

Regardless of how you plan to learn the basics of programming, there are many things that you can do to make the choice of hiring you easier, other than having the classic request of needing job experience to get job experience.

### Change "I know about" to "I have done"

If I was looking for someone to build a house, I am always going to go for the person who has built a table and painted a room over the person who has read a thousand books about architecture and watched every season of grand designs but never picked up a hammer.

It is the same with getting a job, having someone who has a first class degree at a top university is great, but having someone who has built a website or an app and actually understands the challenges they will face, is much more likely to succeed in my eyes.

So go out, pick something that interests you, and make it. The more it interests you, the more likely you are to keep going when it gets difficult. The more you do on a side project, the more challenges you will face and the more you will learn and can talk about to whoever is going to hire you.

At this stage it is not important for it to make money or be ground breaking but as a showcase that you can apply your skills in a real world situation.

Challenge yourself with something that you consider difficult to achieve, as then you will really build the key skills of problem solving and knowledge finding that are required as an engineer.

And remember to not be a perfectionist as many of us are, and prevent ourselves from putting work out there because its not "finished". Something is better than nothing, and if for example you're going for a backend engineering job I don't expect you to have fantastic graphic skills.

If you find it difficult to come up with an idea, or someone is already doing the same thing you want to, then check out contributing to open source projects. These are a fantastic way of getting experience on a bigger project and working as part of a team, but can be intimidating at first to get involved with. There are some fantastic open source communities out there who need every bit of help they can get.

### Target your skillset

Do you want to work for an EV company? Then research whats going on in the industry and take an active interest. Even better do a quick side project on what excites you about EV's, maybe a website that has a catalogue of the progression of mileage per brand, or an api that takes a vehicle registration and returns what car it is. There are many services/api's that have free tiers/quotas you can experiment with, which are perfect for a side project to show interest.

Do you want to work for a startup? Pick up basic skills in a number of areas, maybe dabble in some Product design in Figma, or show you can edit a Wix website or be able to query an AI model. Early stage startups provide a perfect place to grow skills and often look for the generalist. They also can provide great opportunities for junior developers to get started if you are not looking for a hand held approach.

Want to work at Apple one day? Then maybe reverse engineer how they do the animation work on their website and put it on your own. Bigger companies can afford for people to have very specific in depth knowledge, so if you want to work somewhere that requires that then concentrate on the key area.

One of the biggest problems you face, can be not knowing what you don't know yet. In my team we started using [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/), which is free and a great resource to guide you with directing your learning.

### Present yourself in the best light

1. Have your CV ready to go at all times, speed matters and they won't wait for you to update it.
2. Before you apply for a job, research the company and understand what they do.
3. Turn up to interviews/meetings on time, it is amazing how many times people don't turn up on time and give no notice/ghost. Those interviewers will remember and potentially not give you another chance, even when they change company.
4. For phone calls and video calls, be somewhere appropriate. Make sure it is quiet and you have a good connection so you can hear what they are saying and vice versa. Please do not be the one candidate I interviewed for a senior role, who on a zoom interview was outside with no shirt on and a chicken squawking behind him the entire time.
5. Don't pretend you know everything, it is okay to say I haven't come across that, please explain it to me. Particularly for junior developers, people are looking for those who are hungry for knowledge and will be willing to learn all the skills required to have them as a useful long term employee.

### Networking

For better or worse networking works, and it is a good way of getting yourself heard when otherwise you could just be an email or a piece of paper.

Know what type of companies you are targeting and be where they are.

Some possible ways include:

1. Use the product (especially if it has a free option) and become active in their community e.g. X, Discord, GitHub etc.
2. Invest, 2 startups I worked at, I previously invested in on [crowdcube](https://www.crowdcube.com/) (minimal amounts, the amount does not matter). How many people can say going into an interview, I care about this company so much that I put my money in already. Also when a company closes a round there is an increased likelihood they will be hiring, so even if you can't afford to invest at least follow their progress.
3. Go to industry events, is the company you want to join doing a talk or hosting an event, try and go there.
4. Send an email or a LinkedIn request to people at the company, the worst thing that can happen is they don't reply (don't take this personally or badger, you don't know how many recruiters message these people a day üôà).
5. Take part in a hackathon, you get more contacts and a new project for your portfolio in one go.

## Closing off

Getting your first job as a software developer can often be very hard, so make the most of any and all opportunities you have and do the work to make it easy to say yes to hiring you.

Don't be put off by a long list of job requirements, and instead work towards showing you can do the job and are interested in the work other than just through words.

No two people take the same route, and there are plenty of people out there looking to help people succeed.

Best of luck with your hunt for that first job and I hope you have a great start to your career.\
