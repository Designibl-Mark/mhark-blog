# Welcome to Mhark!

A tech focussed blog by [Mark Hardwick](https://bento.me/markh), with a sprinkle of other topics.

## About Me

I am the CTO at [Spot Ship](https:spot-ship.com) 🛳️ a UK startup creating a first class global __"Shipping Platform for Brokers"__ that utilises AI and Machine learning to make the most from your data.

If you want to find out more about how you can invest in our growth or require a platform demo feel free to [get in touch](mailto:mark@spot-ship.com).

I have always been fascinated by technology and what I can make it do. Through my love of video games 🎮 and electronics 🎛️ I have been encouraged to learn to code.

Since then I have picked up skills in a plethora of computing languages and am a strong supporter of rubber duck debugging, with over 200 ducks to choose from. 🦆

### Before Spot Ship

I founded, __Designibl__ a technology startup in the UK. That went on hiatus as a consequence of Covid-19 whilst trying to create & launch a hospitality service that closed the feedback loop between transient populations and the companies that service them.
