# Welcome to Mhark!

Welcome to this blog by [Mark](https://bento.me/markh)!

## About Me

I am the CTO at [Spot Ship](https:spot-ship.com), a UK startup creating a first class global __"Shipping Platform for Brokers"__ that utilises AI and Machine learning to make the most from your data.

If you want to find out more about how you can invest in our growth or require a platform demo feel free to get in touch.

I have always been fascinated by technology and what I can make it do. Through my love of video games and electronics, I have been encouraged to learn to code. Since then I have picked up skills in a plethora of computing languages and am a strong supporter of rubber duck debugging, with over 200 ducks to choose from.

### Previous Experience

I previously founded, Designibl a technology startup in the UK. That went on hiatus as a consequence of Covid-19 whilst trying to create & launch a hospitality app that closed the feedback loop between transient populations and the companies that service them.

Other sectors I have worked in include EV & Energy Management ([Andersen EV](https://andersen-ev.com/), [Electric Miles](https://electricmiles.com/)), IOT & Smart Buildings (District Technologies & [Ome](https://omeproducts.com/)) & Retail ([Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/))

### Things I Champion and Strive For

- Truly accessible applications with fantastic UX.
- Creating and implementing amazing customer-centric experiences especially digital products.
- Creating a happy, transparent and mutual growth focussed team culture to ensure long term career goals are met whilst getting the best out of the team.
- Getting as far as fast as I can whilst retaining quality, through excellent DevEx processes, tooling and systems.
